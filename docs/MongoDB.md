## Implementation Notes

### MongoDB Configuration
We've configured MongoDB with the following settings:
- Database name: `frinny_agent`
- Collection: `agent_state`
- Authentication: Username/password authentication with admin source
- Volume mount: Persistent volume for data storage
- Health checks: Configured to verify MongoDB is running properly before starting dependent services

### Testing Setup
Two test files have been created to verify MongoDB functionality:
1. `test_state_persistence.py` - Updated to work with MongoDB
   - Tests basic conversation persistence
   - Tests complex persistence with topic changes
   - Tests persistence after restart

2. `test_mongodb_persistence.py` - MongoDB-specific tests
   - Tests MongoDB connection
   - Tests checkpoint creation in MongoDB
   - Tests checkpoint retrieval from MongoDB
   
### Running Tests
**Important:** MongoDB must be running in Docker for all tests to work. Use the following commands:

```bash
# Start MongoDB first
docker-compose up -d mongodb

# Run tests
docker-compose run test-persistence
docker-compose run test-mongodb
```

For more detailed information about testing, see `docs/Testing.md`.

### Migration Notes
When migrating from SQLite to MongoDB:
- Existing conversation history is not automatically migrated
- MongoDB uses a different storage mechanism for state checkpoints
- The application will create new checkpoints in MongoDB for new conversations

### Fallback Mechanism
If MongoDB connection fails:
- The system falls back to in-memory storage
- A warning is logged indicating persistence will not work
- The application continues to function but state won't persist between restarts
